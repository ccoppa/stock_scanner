# stock_scanner

There are way too many stocks, their price movements and balance sheets to keep track of. 
As a lone investor, I want to automate some of the screening process and leave the heavy liftings to algorithms.
Here in this project, I created a module that would connect to the database of yahoo finance API, query the data based on certain fundamental stock screening criteria (e.g. P/E, gross/operating/profit margin, market cap, industry, etc.), and deliver the results in anice format directly to my inbox every morning.
This auto-screening would greatly help me reducing the load off my shoulder and narrowing my targets, and allow me to be more efficient working on more interesting tasks -- stock analysis.
